# Covid19-tracker
### Tracker app summary
This is an app which helps the user to</br>
* Monitor their symptoms for COVID-19</br>
* Identify individuals with whom they have been in contact</br>
* Mark the location of places they have visited</br>
The app prompts the user to track their symptoms, 
other users they have come in contact with and the places they have visited for 14 days.
After the 14 day period, the app will provide a percentage match between user symptoms and symptoms
outlined by the CDC and WHO. Based on this percentage value, users are urged to take necessary
precautions (sourced from local health authorities).<br />
If the the user has a high match rating then health authorities are immediately contacted so the
user can be tested. The health officials can access the user data upon approval from the user.
If the test results are positive, then all users the individual has come in contact with for the
past 14 days are alerted that they may have been exposed to the virus and are informed to self-isolate.
Additionally, areas with users who have tested positive for COVID-19 are shown on a map in red,
which other users can see. If they must leave their house, are informed to avoid those areas.
The intensity of the color of these marked areas decreases eventually with time.
The analysis of the location collected will allow governments to identify geographic hotspots,
thus allowing better allocation of resources.
